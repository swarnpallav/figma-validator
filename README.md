# Figma Validator

A developer tool to validate implemented UI against Figma designs in real time.

Figma Validator consists of:

- A Figma Plugin to capture style properties from selected design elements
- A Chrome Extension to compare those styles with live webpage elements

It helps reduce manual inspection time and ensures pixel-accurate implementation.
